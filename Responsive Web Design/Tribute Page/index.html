    <p class="header"><strong>Difference Engine</strong></p>
    <p class="txt">Babbage began working on a machine he called a Difference Engine in 1822. The machine was built to calculate values of polynomial functions. By using the method of finite differences it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division. During the construction of the prototype, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design, but they had a falling out in 1831 over costs.</p>
    <p class="txt">The Difference Engine was never completed, but had it been completed it would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed 15 tons, and been 8 feet tall. Babbage later designed an improved version, the "Difference Engine #2", but did not receive funding for it. It was constructed in 1991 using his plans, and to 19<sup>th</sup> century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum of London, returning results to 31 digits.</p>
    <p class="header"><strong>Analytical Engine</strong></p>
    <p class="txt">After Babbage's failed attempt at constructing the Differnce Engine, he designed a more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine marked the transition from simple arithmatic to general purpose computation. It is due to this that Babbage is considered the father of computers.</p>
    <p class="txt">One of the major advances the Analytical Enginge had was that the machine was programmed using punch cards. The punch cards controlled a mechanical calculator, which could also use the results of preceding calculations as inputs. The machine was also intended to use many features that modern computers have today, such as sequential control, branching, and looping. With all of its features, it would have been Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single machine, but a succession of designs that Babbage worked on until his death.</p>
